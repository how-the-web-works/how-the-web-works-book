Computer networks started to be used back in the 1950s.
ARPANET, the precursor of the internet, initially connected four nodes in 1969.
Connecting computers became something common in the 80s and 90s with the concept of the BBS, or bulletin board system.
The evolution of all these systems, and all the iterations we went through, culminated into what we call today as the Internet.

The Internet is based on multiple standards created and managed by many organizations around the world.
These standards is what hold this network of countless computers talking to each other together.
In this book, you’ll learn everything that happens inside servers that run the Internet.
The standards, the protocols, the details, everything, from scratch.

From the moment you type an address on your browser to the moment when the request reaches the server and all the magic starts to happen.
You’ll write your own HTTP server, your own protocols and understand all there is under the hood.
Then you'll learn how to use this knowledge to build the modern patterns that permeate the complex applications that we depend on a day-to-day basis.
