Hardware and software evolved exponentially since the 1950s when the first computer was created.
Knowledge develops faster as we build on the "shoulders of giants".
But sometimes, we need to get back down and understand what's going on so that we can rethink our foundations, and build stronger, more advanced paradigms for others to build on top of.

Most of the new software developers are learning to program with frameworks and tools from previous generation without understanding what's happening behind the scenes.
And they struggle with the smallest of the problems because of the lack of context and not knowing where to look for the solution.
A lot don't even know how or what to "google for" when something breaks.

Don't get me wrong, frameworks are great for getting things up and running fast.
But they are solutions to problems, and not understaing the problems, make it really hard to understand the solutions.

The intent of this book is to be the path where you'll learn about all the old problems, and then build the solutions to solve them.
The idea is to build things from scratch: from a web server to a web browser.
All the bits and pieces that exist to make the internet works.
