title: Hello Process
---

To illustrate this, let's write an application that generates random numbers and prints them to standard output in an infinite loop until it receives a SIGTERM signal. SIGTERM means that the application should terminate.
In Java, the following is an infinite loop that will print a random number and then sleep for a second:

```java
Random random = new Random();
while (true) { // Infinite loop
  int next = random.nextInt(1000);
  System.out.printf("Next random number was: %d\n", next);
  Thread.sleep(1000);
}
```

In Java, thereâ€™s no way to catch specific signals sent to the process. These are captured by the JVM which decides what to do. The only thing you can do is run a piece of code if the process is terminating. To do that, you register a shutdown hook thread like the following:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
  @Override
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Process is shutting down...");
  }
});
