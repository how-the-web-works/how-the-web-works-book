Computers were created to process data.
To do that, we need a way to give data for it to process and extract the results of the processing.
When computers were invented, back in the 1950s, they were one of a kind thing.
Programming one meant dealing with very specific circuits and electronic components.
As time passed, inputting data evolved from changing circuits, to punch cards and finally keyboard and mouse.
Outputting data evolved from light bulbs and small printers to TVs and LCDs.

Another thing that evolved was storage.
Storing computer programs and data files evolved from the punch cards to magnetic tapes, to magnetic disks and solid state drives.

Initially, programs were designed to start, process a lot of data and finish showing the results of complex calculations.
As programs became more complex it was clear that they needed ways to communicate with each other.
Processes can communicate with others in the same machine or in other machines.
In this chapter weâ€™re going to discuss the most common ways programs communicate.
