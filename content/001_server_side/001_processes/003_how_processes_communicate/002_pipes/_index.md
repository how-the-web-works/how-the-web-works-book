During the early beginnings of computers, to deal with input from and output to the user, you needed to have deep knowledge about the system you were working on. You would need to spend time writing code to communicate with each specific input devices like the keyboard. And the same was true for output devices like TVs.
Since that has to be done again and again, the Unix team came up with the brilliant idea of standardizing inputs and outputs. They called it Standard Streams and handled all inputs and output devices as a stream of bytes.
